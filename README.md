## Description

Psychological illnesses are increasing at a very fast pace in this rapidly  changing world. Most of people aren't aware of the illnesses they are going through, even if they are aware They can't express it to their friends, family or specialist. We can build a chatbot and voice bot(CX phone integration) Which will respond to people's inputs. We can also reduce the possibilities of suisides if we can solve their mental suffering. Dialogflow CX is inteliigent and advanced enough to take and give responses equal to humans. Customers can openly share their feelings with bots easier than people because bot's don't judge.
